title: 5 Reasons I Chose Johns Hopkins' Online AI Masters Program Over Duke, UC Berkeley, and Northwestern's Programs

# Introduction

I started searching for AI masters programs in 2022 because AI would be a fun career path. It's also very lucrative. From 2023 to 2024, the AI market has jumped from around \$50 billion to \$184 billion according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1474143/global-ai-market-size#:~:text=AI%20market%20size%20worldwide%20from,2030%20(in%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars)&text=The%20market%20for%20artificial%20intelligence,billion%20U.S.%20dollars%20in%202030.). I also wanted to get my masters part-time instead of stopping work for two years because two year's of salary is a big opportunity cost. I wasn't interested in any programs in my area, so I looked for strong online programs. 

After much research, I was considering these online programs:

* Duke's [Master of Engineering in AI](https://ai.meng.duke.edu/).
* UC Berkeley's [Master in Data Science (MIDS)](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/).
* Johns Hopkins's [Master of Science in AI](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence/).
* Northwestern's [Master of Science in Data Science](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/).

In the end I chose Johns Hopkins' [AI Master of Science Program](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence/) for the following reasons:

1. [Fully online curriculum aimed at working professionals](#1).
2. [No GRE](#2).
3. [Better electives](#3).
4. [Highly ranked and prestigious university](#4).
5. [No thesis or capstone required](#5).

Since my work was paying for my tuition, cost wasn't a strong factor for me. 

# 1. Fully Online Curriculum Aimed at Working Professionals <a name="1"></a>

Johns Hopkins AI program is through their [Engineering for Professionals](https://ep.jhu.edu/) programs. I liked that the class sizes are small, and everyone else would be a working professional like me. UC Berkeley and Northwestern programs also target working professionals, but they require a capstone/thesis, so I would likely have to go there for the capstone/thesis. Duke is hybrid where some students are online and some are not. I didn't like that because I worried that the in-person students would get better treatment while the online ones would be more of an afterthought.

I was probably most impressed by UC Berkeley's program. TODO: add why. I can't remember.

# 2. No GRE <a name="2"></a>

None of these programs required a GRE. Many high quality in-person programs require a GRE. 

# 3. Better Electives <a name="3"></a>

**Johns Hopkins AI program allows you to take more electives than the other programs.**

Johns Hopkins AI program requires ten classes: four core classes and six electives. Northwestern requires eleven classes and a thesis/capstone. Only two of the eleven classes are electives. Duke requires 10 classes and a capstone. Likewise, only two of the ten are electives. UC Berkeley is shorter with 8 classes and a capstone. Four of the eight are electives. 

I liked being able to choose more of my classes. I also didn't like some of the core classes in the other programs. For example, Duke and Northwestern require some management/business classes. UC Berkeley electives were too broad. I already work in Data Science, so I wanted more niche classes.

**Johns Hopkins AI Program has more electives to choose from.** 

Johns Hopkins has x number of electives. 
Northwestern has x.
Duke has x.
UC Berkeley has x.

**Johns Hopkins electives are more specialized.**

For example, here are half of the UC Berkeley electives:

* Experiments and Causal Inference
* Behind the Data: Humans and Values
* Machine Learning Systems Engineering
* Computer Vision
* Generative AI: Foundations, Techniques, Challenges, and Opportunities

Some really great elective choices, but there weren't next level classes. What if I wanted to take a second computer vision elective? 

Meanwhile, Johns Hopkins allows for much further specialization:

* Reinforcement Learning - Introduction to Robotics - Human Robotics Interaction - UAV Systems and Control
* Reasoning Under Uncertainty - Evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence - Intelligent Algorithms
* Natural Language Processing - Large Language Models: Theory and Practice - Building and Training Large Language Models
* Creating AI Enabled Systems (core) - Optimizing and Deploying Scalable AI Systems
  
# 4. Highly Ranked and Prestigious University <a name="4"></a>

These schools are all quite highly ranked except for UC Berkeley. I liked Johns Hopkins for the medical networking. I eventually want to do AI in the medical industry. 

# 5. No Thesis or Capstone Required <a name="5"></a>

All the programs require a thesis or capstone except for Johns Hopkins.
