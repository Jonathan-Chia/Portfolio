# Introduction

Some notes on OOP.

## **Difference between _self_ and other variables**

Notice here how output _predicted__ gets saved into _self_. 

The difference between X and _self_ is that X is a variable that comes in, whereas _self_ is a variable that is saved and used throughout the whole class. _self.predicted__ can be used in other defs 

Notice the _self.intercept__ and _self.coef__. Instead of starting the def with predict(coef_, intercept_, X), I can start the def with just predict(self, X).
