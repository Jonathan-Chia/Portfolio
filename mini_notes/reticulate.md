Chia, Jonathan : Copy of Use Both R and Python with Reticulate
==============================================================

Created by Chia, Jonathan on Apr 09, 2022

Reticulate lets you switch between Python and R in one R Markdown document

Notice that the python object **flights** was referenced in R using **py$flights**Â 

Reticulate Setup Template:
--------------------------

[Template.rmd](/download/attachments/95650210/reticulate.rmd)

  

Strengths:
----------

1.  You can code in Python and then switch to R for Shiny Dashboards
2.  You can pick and choose your favorite packages from either R or Python - ggplot vs seaborn, caret vs sklearn, etc.
3.  You can keep your R and python projects together in one place
4.  You can create beautiful R markdown reports that display both R and Python outputs

Weaknesses:
-----------

1.  Can feel a little clunky especially if you are used to Python IDE's
2.  Python objects do not show up in the R environment window - it will show up if our R server is updated to have newest RStudio
3.  You can use R in Jupyter Notebooks if you prefer Python
4.  You have to be reliant on the reticulate package to use Python
